## NYC Programs to Improve Environment
When observing and exploring NYC's Clean Heat Program, DEP Boiler Registration, and the Greater Greener Buildings plan; the programs meant to help the environment implemented by New York City. Fuels 4 and 6 are very harmful and heavy, posing high risks to health and aquatic life. The NYC Clean Heat Programs main focus is on reducing green house gas emissions and improving overall air quality. They do this by having buildings transitioning from using heavy heating oils, like 4 and 6, to more natural gases. To help this transition move along the building owners are given grants and financial incentives. In addition to this the DEP Boiler Registration sysytem is in place to regulate and monitor the boiler systems in New York and make sure they are all up to date. These boilers contribute heavily to pollution so it is important to make sure that these boilers don't violate and codes, the ones that burn oil are meant to be reduced, and eventually eliminated. Which would improve the quality of air and make it less dirty. Overall, the city has found many ways to contribute to the improvement of our environment due to the critical state it is in becasue of our man made industrial machines and overall disregard for our environments well being.

## NYC Emissions
- New York City faces significant greenhouse gas emissions, primarily from the burning of fossil fuels for electricity, with an emphasis on aging power plants. Buildings, particularly those constructed in the 1950s, contribute two-thirds of the city's greenhouse gas emissions, prompting legislative measures like Local Law 97 to reduce emissions by 80% by 2050.
- The breakdown of emissions by building type highlights the significant impact of large buildings, particularly in Manhattan, which has the highest population density. The energy inefficiency of appliances in densely populated areas further contributes to the demand for electricity.
- The city passed new legislation, specifically a 2026 ban on fossil fuels in most new buildings

## Exploring Data!!

Here we can see the Boiler Capacities for all of our neighborhoods. It is clear that Kips Bay has the highest Boiler Capacity.

It can be seen that Hells Kitchen has the highest mean total usage of gallons depsite Kips Bay having the highest boiler capacity. This is due to the fact that the boilers in Hells Kitchen are signigicantly larger.

The graph shows that most of the boiler ages range between 16 to 30 years old. Showing that most of these boilers aren't that old and that is good because that means the city is doing it's job to make sure these boilers are up to date.

Here we can see that there is no correlation between the number of floors a building has nad the amount of gallons of fuels used.

Most of the greener greater building are in the Upper East Side, then following is Greenwich, and Kips Bay. It appears that in Hells Kitchen and Soho they fall pretty short in comparison to the others.
