When observing and exploring NYC's Clean Heat Program, DEP Boiler Registration, and the Greater Greener Buildings plan; the programs meant to help the environment implemented by New York City. Fuels 4 and 6 are very harmful and heavy, posing high risks to health and aquatic life. The NYC Clean Heat Programs main focus is on reducing green house gas emissions and improving overall air quality. They do this by having buildings transitioning from using heavy heating oils, like 4 and 6, to more natural gases. To help this transition move along the building owners are given grants and financial incentives. In addition to this the DEP Boiler Registration sysytem is in place to regulate and monitor the boiler systems in New York and make sure they are all up to date. These boilers contribute heavily to pollution so it is important to make sure that these boilers don't violate and codes, the ones that burn oil are meant to be reduced, and eventually eliminated. Which would improve the quality of air and make it less dirty. Overall, the city has found many ways to contribute to the improvement of our environment due to the critical state it is in becasue of our man made industrial machines and overall disregard for our environments well being.

New York City faces significant greenhouse gas emissions, primarily from the burning of fossil fuels for electricity, with an emphasis on aging power plants. Buildings, particularly those constructed in the 1950s, contribute two-thirds of the city's greenhouse gas emissions, prompting legislative measures like Local Law 97 to reduce emissions by 80% by 2050. The breakdown of emissions by building type highlights the significant impact of large buildings, particularly in Manhattan, which has the highest population density. The energy inefficiency of appliances in densely populated areas further contributes to the demand for electricity. However, the city is actively addressing these challenges by passing new legislation, including a 2026 ban on fossil fuels in most new buildings, reflecting a commitment to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly future for New York City.
